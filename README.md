# IoT-Sensor-design
IoT system which consists of sensor nodes, a gateway and the back end system.
## Project Details  
The project must be a IoT system which consists of sensor nodes, a gateway and the back end system.  
1. Sensor node includes sensors, micro-controller, wireless module, and actuators.  
2. Gateway has a wireless module for receiving data from sensor nodes. In addition, it is able to process the data and store the data in the local database for real-time accessing. The gateway must forward or send the raw or processed data to Cloud which does more data processing.  
3. The back-system can be a terminal, web-page or an application which can monitor real-time data from sensors and provide commands for controlling actuators.
