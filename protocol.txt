Sensor longpoll
- The response to a longpoll consists of a concatenation of messages of the form:
  - 1 byte: the type of msg
  - 2 bytes: length of content (big-endian, as in network byte order)
  - content
- Message types:
  - 1 = led
  - 2 = siren_ctrl
  - 3 = smoke_sleep
  - 4 = audio_stream
  - 5 = token
- The last message is a "token" message.

Sensor event
- Sensor sends "smoke_on", "smoke_off", or "motion" as the "event" field of HTTP GET.

Gui longpoll
- Gui sends an HTTP GET, with possibly some value as the "token" field.
  - If token is empty or non-existent, longpoll-server returns immediately, reporting the current state.
  - Otherwise, longpoll-server waits until an event happens and sends the new changes to the state.
  - Every response includes a token to be used in subsequent requests.

Gui event
- LED ctrl
  - On
  - Off
  - Blink
- Audio streaming
- Smoke sensor ctrl
  - Disable for an amount of time
- Audio ctrl
  - Enable/Disable alarm sounds
